# p5 global (default) and instance mode

p5 is a javascript sketching library based on [processing](https://processing.org/), check it out [here](https://p5js.org/get-started/). It is unfortunate that when you include p5 in your project (via cdn resource), it will create bunch of globals. There is a reason globals shall not be used when creating a library, we do not want name clashing (p5 has a globals like `width` and `height`, so you can't use it for anything else). Fortunately there is an _instance_ mode with which you can create a p5 sketch from a function containing a sketch instance that contains all the functions and variables that would be otherwise globals in the p5 documentation.

```jsx
// ----------------------------------------------------
// default
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}

// ----------------------------------------------------
// instance mode
const s = (sketch) => {
  sketch.setup = () => {
    sketch.createCanvas(400, 400);
  };

  sketch.draw = () => {
    sketch.background(220);
  };
};

let myp5 = new p5(s);
```

While following the p5 tutorials, I will be have to include `sketch.` before each function/variable/event handler mentioned. Example from https://p5js.org/get-started/ :

```jsx
// ----------------------------------------------------
// example from https://p5js.org/get-started/
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}

// ----------------------------------------------------
// converted to instance mode
const s = (sketch) => {
  sketch.setup = () => {
    sketch.createCanvas(400, 400);
  };

  sketch.draw = () => {
    if (sketch.mouseIsPressed) {
      sketch.fill(0);
    } else {
      sketch.fill(255);
    }
    sketch.ellipse(sketch.mouseX, sketch.mouseY, 80, 80);
  };
};

let myp5 = new p5(s);
```

# Integration in React

If I want to include p5 in react app, I need to manage the instance and the canvas, which is not straightforward. This is what I came up with, I admit I had help from Svarog that works at Koji, see his work here https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import p5 from "p5";

const s = (sketch) => {
  sketch.setup = () => {
    sketch.createCanvas(400, 400);
  };

  sketch.draw = () => {
    sketch.background(220);
  };
};

export default function Game() {
  let canvasContainerRef = useRef();
  let sketchRef = useRef();

  //mount
  useEffect(() => {
    sketchRef.current = new p5(s, canvasContainerRef.current);

    //unmount
    return () => {
      if (sketchRef.current) {
        sketchRef.current.remove();
        sketchRef.current = null;
      }
    };
  }, []);

  return <div ref={canvasContainerRef}></div>;
}
```

This react effect works with creating and cleaning up the canvas.

Breaking this down, we can see that outside the `Game` component we have a p5 sketch function for instance mode. Inside the `Game` component, we have two references - one for the p5 instance and the other for a DOM container for a canvas where the p5 sketch will draw. Unmounting the component will remove the sketch instance.

The result of running this component is a light gray 400x400 rectangle:
