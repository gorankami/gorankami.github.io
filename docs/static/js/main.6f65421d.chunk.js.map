I'm Goran, nice to meet you :)</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My career is in programming.

I can describe myself as a\r\n        javascript generalist, though I do not wary from learning pretty much\r\n        anything related to the product I am working on. I've built C# desktop\r\n        apps (<a href=\"https://see.asseco.com/\">Asseco SEE</a>\r\n        ), backends (Astria d.o.o.) and games (\r\n        <a href=\"https://twodesperados.com/\">Two Desperados</a>\r\n        ), was working on shaders and 3D graphics with WebGL, used experimental\r\n        features of WebRTC for bioauthentication (\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.daon.com/\">Daon</a>\r\n        ), automated projects with CI/CD, administrated windows and linux\r\n        servers, managed a project or two (\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.risk-technologies.com/\">Steinbeis R-Tech</a>\r\n        ).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        But the biggest success was leading a team of developers at\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.tradecore.com/\">TradeCore</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In personal life, I am living in a small universe of music and reading.\r\n        I was training capoiera for a big part of my life, traveled the world\r\n        partly because of it, but stayed in Serbia so I can be close to friends\r\n        and family.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I am currently on a tough corona sabbatical, and actively looking for\r\n        work.

I was playing with\r\n        ideas on how to do it, should it be highly personal? Or maybe strictly\r\n        professional with a portfolio? I did want to show and write about the\r\n        things I do in programming, but somehow everytime I daydream about the\r\n        site it was too overwhelming to plan, and I couldn't find value in the\r\n        invested work.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I've stumbled upon Luke Smith videos on youtube{' '}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz\">here</a>, and he\r\n        inspired me to create my personal website. He was making tons of linux\r\n        and programming videos but in between there were plenty philosophical\r\n        ones - I can't say I can agree on everything, but I have respect for how\r\n        he sticks to his ideas and shows them in practice.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Main takeaways for me - Linkedin, facebook and instagram represented my\r\n        presence, but those are such awful mediums. I think everyone feels the\r\n        same, but noone can find a reason not to be there. Linkedin for example\r\n        is an endless sea of bullshit moral stories. Instagram the fakest idea\r\n        of lifestyle you could imagine. Facebook... the very active are the\r\n        craziest.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Sharing my thoughts on social networks doesn't seem to take any\r\n        attention. And I get it, I think the feeds are fatiguing, what are my\r\n        thought's if you sandwitch them between ads and fake news? I also think\r\n        that, if anyone is interested in you, they would come to visit your page\r\n        directly and take a look what's new in your life. Social networks are\r\n        not made for people to share thoughts, they are made to play with your\r\n        emotions and show you some ads.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I also have a <a href=\"https://github.com/gorankami\">github account</a>{' '}\r\n        (like every other programmer), but I think I need a suplement for it, so\r\n        I beleive that will be my main focus on blog here.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The site you are looking at right now was at first created with pure\r\n        html and css. What an awful mistake. I was working on three pages, and\r\n        copy pasting header from one to another, and then I change a header on\r\n        one, forget to change to the other... you know what I mean. I did not\r\n        intend to have it like that, I planned to only start queckly. Moved it\r\n        to react anyway, it's much easier to write and faster to the user.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Anyway, thank you Luke Smith.
