      <p>Hey there! I'm Goran</p>
      <p>
        My career is in programming. The first site I created was back in 2007
        at the university, single html page with links and instructions for
        microsoft products for students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been wearing many hats since then. I can describe myself as a
        javascript generalist, though I do not wary from learning pretty much
        anything related to the product I am working on. I've built C# desktop
        apps (<a href="https://see.asseco.com/">Asseco SEE</a>
        ), backends (Astria d.o.o.) and games (
        <a href="https://twodesperados.com/">Two Desperados</a>
        ), was working on shaders and 3D graphics with WebGL, used experimental
        features of WebRTC for bioauthentication (
        <a href="https://www.daon.com/">Daon</a>
        ), automated projects with CI/CD, administrated windows and linux
        servers, managed a project or two (
        <a href="https://www.risk-technologies.com/">Steinbeis R-Tech</a>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the biggest success was leading a team of developers at{' '}

      <p>
        In personal life, I am living in a small universe of music and reading.
        I was training capoiera for a big part of my life, traveled the world
        partly because of it, but stayed in Serbia so I can be close to friends
        and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently on a tough corona sabbatical, and actively looking for
        work. In the meantime, I have fun researching and creating apps.
