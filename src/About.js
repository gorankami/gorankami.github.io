      <p>Hey there! I'm Goran</p>
      <p>
        My career is in programming. The first web site I created was back in
        2007 at the university.

        I've been wearing many hats since then. I can describe myself as a
        javascript generalist, though I do not wary from learning pretty much
        anything related to the product I am working on. I've built C# desktop
        apps, backends and games , was working on shaders and 3D graphics with
        WebGL, used experimental features of WebRTC for bioauthentication,
        automated projects with CI/CD, administrated windows and linux servers,
        managed a project or two, and lead a team of frontend developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In personal life, I am living in a small universe of music and reading.
        I was training capoiera for a big part of my life, traveled the world
        partly because of it, but stayed in Serbia so I can be close to friends
        and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently on a tough corona sabbatical, and actively looking for
        work. In the meantime, I have fun researching and creating apps.
